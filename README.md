# BKA Auckland - Software Developer Technical Test

## Project Description
The project is an online shopping cart application that has already been implemented. However, the current code has maintenance and quality issues that need to be addressed. Your task is to refactor and write unit tests for the existing code.

## Technical Test Objectives
- Evaluate your skills in refactoring and improving existing code.
- Evaluate your skills in writing unit tests for refactored code.
- Evaluate the quality of your refactored code and unit tests.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C#.NET
- Unit Testing Framework: NUnit

## Instructions
1. Clone the technical test repository to your local computer.
2. Open the C#.NET project in your preferred IDE.
3. Carefully read the existing code and determine areas that require refactoring.
4. Refactor the code following SOLID design principles and best programming practices.
5. Write unit tests for the refactored code using NUnit.
6. Ensure that all unit tests pass and provide good code coverage.
7. Document your work in this README file, including any significant improvements you have made and challenges you have faced.

## Solution
I am happy to report that I have completed the technical test and have successfully refactored the code and written unit tests to ensure its functionality.

### Changes Made
- Refactored code to follow SOLID design principles and best programming practices.
- Improved code quality and maintainability.
- Wrote unit tests using NUnit to ensure proper functionality and good code coverage.

Thank you
